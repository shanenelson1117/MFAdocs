# Building on Top of My Favorite Albums

My Favorite Album’s modularity, general data format (CSV), and use of open-source software make it an excellent starting point for implementing increased functionality. Some ideas for building on top of My Favorite Albums are:

* Integrating Spotify’s API to gain access to listening data.  
* Integrating Discog’s API to gain access to album data such as covers and genre.  
* Expanding the CSV file to add more user data  
* Implementing new functions based on increased user or API data  
* Using **ggplot2** (an R data visualization package) to create new plots

These ideas serve as good starting points and can be simple to implement on top of My Favorite Album’s base functionality.
