### Why Use My Favorite Albums?

My Favorite Albums is a tool that allows users with minimal programming experience to visualize and store rankings of their favorite albums. With My Favorite Albums, users rank and compare albums they listen to with a simply formatted webpage, keeping a detailed log of their favorite music. After inputting their rating data, users can view their favorite albums by year or by band, and can even compare bands to see how they stack up. The software also allows users to track their vinyl collections and keep note of the vinyl they wish to add to their collection.
