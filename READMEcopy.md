### Why Use My Favorite Albums?

My Favorite Albums is a customizable music ranking data visualization tool built on the Shiny R Library. Shiny is an R Library which allows developers to easily create web pages without having to write JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. Shiny Apps are reactive which means that the app automatically changes with user input, allowing developers to focus on data manipulation. My Favorite Albums is highly modularized meaning that new features can easily be implemented alongside current functionality. These features allow experienced developers an easily modifiable codebase. My Favorite Albums also uses CSV files whose universality allows the app to easily interface with external tools. Developers can easily expand its capabilities by adding new functions, expanding CSV files, and taking advantage of Shinyâ€™s functionality.
